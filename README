This is a very simple form, using native Javascript & jQuery, PHP with Ajax.

When we submit form, there is some little verifications,
then datas are send asynchronously, and added in the 2 arrays below : one get its datas from db, the other one from a txt file.
We can delete or edit by clicking on a button, a message will be displayed, and datas updated from db & txt file
